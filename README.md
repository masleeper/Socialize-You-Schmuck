# Socialize-You-Schmuck

This is a fairly rudimentary chat site that uses AngularJS for the front end, and PHP with SQL on the back end. This
service supports chatting with multiple users at once, having chats that persists even after logging out, and creating
a friends list. No further updates will be made to this as this was only made for a school project.
